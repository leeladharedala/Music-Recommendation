We are using a dataset of top Spotify songs from the year 2010 to 2019. here we are classifying popularity, danceability, valence from the song attribute values like artist_name, track_id, track_name, acousticness, danceability, duration_ms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time_signature, valence, popularity. 

In the visualities we are comparing two songs and getting danceability and valence, energy, speechiness, instumentalness and liveness values of the song and also, we can get the most used words in the popular songs like artist_name, track_id, track_name, acousticness, danceability, duration_ms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time_signature, valence, popularity.

On our first visualization we have a filter of Radar, bubble chart and cloud. If we click on any one of that then we will be redirect to viz2

On visualization 2 based on the selection at viz1, if we click on radar, it shows us comparison of two songs(we can select whatever songs we want to compare) in terms of danceability and valence, energy, speechiness, instumentalness and liveness values of the song. 
If we click on bubble, we can classify the particular artist songs based on the popularity and time signature in a graph, where x-axis is danceability and y-axis is valence. 
If we click on the cloud, it shows us the most frequent words used in the top popular songs from 2010-2019 in Spotify and its word count when you hover on it.
